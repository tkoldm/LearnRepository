This project is example for Chapter 4. 

When we need a single instance of some class in program, best way to implement this behavior is singleton design pattern. 

We can store the state and use the already created instance. This behavior is available through the `getInstance` static method, which returns the value of a static field with an instance that was created with a private constructor.
